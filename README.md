# Tauri GitHub Action

This GitHub Action builds your Web application as a Tauri native binary for MacOS, Linux and Windows.
If your project doesn't include the Tauri files, we create it at compile time, so if you don't need to use Tauri's API, you can just ship native apps through this Action.

# Example workflow

This workflow builds `Tauri` desktop apps and uploads the artifacts to a GitHub Release.
